Aaauuuugh how can I explain how interested I am in the rows of tiny envelopes of color at clay supply stores?? 

I want colored clay. I don't want to make it marbled. I don't want to do anything fancy with it. I just want really brightly colored clay and no glaze. 

I mean...look at these clay colors. Gasp.

Obviously I can create beautiful colors with glaze. Why does this seem better? B/c it's not just putting a layer on it, it's like...coloring the essence of it. 

Anyways, I'm trying it! 
I bought two tiny envelopes, mostly chosen by least expensive.

I've been reading a lot about it. I'm going to wedge each of these into a 1.25 to 1.5 lb of clay and see what happens. 

Supposedly the celadon has cobalt in it so it's more likely to be bright. 

Oh yeah, and most Mason stains are toxic heavy metals. So I gotta be careful and shit. Kind of a pain. 
So I see why everyone doesn't do this.

Hmm. Well. So far it's been a total disaster.
