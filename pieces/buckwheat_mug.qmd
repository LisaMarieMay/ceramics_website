Listen, don't tell the rest of the mugs, but right out of the kiln this is one of the best mugs of its cohort. 

It's big, it's strong, it's a simple mug. It's not an artist, it might not be _interesting_ with crows or such, but it doesn't need all that. It's perfect as it is. 

Also obsessed with this buckwheat glaze. On a test tile I was all "boring, when would I ever want that?" 

But for this it's just right. Look at how it breaks over the carving, it's eeeeiiii so good.
