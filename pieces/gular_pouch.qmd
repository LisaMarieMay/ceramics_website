I've watched "my crows" a lot (obviously) and noticed that sometimes they'd put whole cashews in their mouths, while other times they'd peck apart the cashew and eat small pieces. 

I vaguely thought birds have some sort of throat pouch thing, right? 

Well, I googled it, and it's called a gular pouch! And yep, they can put food in there to cache for later or take to their kiddos. 

I really think I can tell when they're loading up that pouch or when they're eating. The body language is different, and their throats definetely do distend. And I'm starting to notice when they take food back out of the pouch and eat it. 

You know that old ad slogan "What's in your wallet?" I keep thinking "What's in your gular pouch?"
