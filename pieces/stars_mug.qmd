Inspired by looking at a picture of [this stars cup](stars_cup.html), I made this! For these, I always need the mountains/land/horizon to be waaaayyy down on the mug, because I'm chasing that feeling of laying in a field as a kid in the plains of Montana, with the sky a bowl above me. BIG SKY. 

This mug will do you right. She's good to hold, she's a good size, good vibes. 

Durable stoneware, dishwasher and microwave safe.
