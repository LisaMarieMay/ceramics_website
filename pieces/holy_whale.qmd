Okay, okay, okay - this is glazed and ready for the final fire. Looks so ugly with glaze not fired! Also...unfired glaze ugly paint => melts to glass is wild.

This is a big deal b/c:  
    - first sculpture cutting it open and in pieces to hollow out  
    - first time actually taking the time to run test tiles to plan the glaze instead of just hoping for the best.

So many times, the battle isn't knowing the right thing to do but finding the patience and give a shit to actually do it the way that'll turn out cool. 

It's like I need a solid 2 years of "no, I'm not doing that. You can't make me." And then I finally surrender to needing to be patient and work hard at something, at which point I do a deep dive and then I'm good at it.
