Male humpbacks sing for hours, spiraling slowly as their voices carry for miles. This sculpture holds that moment — peaceful, embodied, part of the great chorus.

Hand sculpted in stoneware for lasting durability, indoors or out. Dimensions: 16" × 8" × 4" (41 × 20 × 10 cm). Two mounting holes allow for easy hanging with nails, screws, or wire.

Stoneware goes through two firings. Here it is after sculpting, before the first fire — and a glimpse of the hollowing process that makes large pieces possible.
