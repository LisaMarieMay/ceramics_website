One of "my" crows is tall! I think. They're very hard to tell apart.

Why is this exciting? Because I'm starting to get to know them as individuals.

I spend a lot of time thinking about the little leg feathers they have. Like little trousers, little jodpurs, little feather leggings they pull on in the morning.

Look at this crow. This is a tall crow. I swear to god.
