She's a small mug (6 oz/182 mL), for a Sunday morning when you're close to the coffee pot or have a pot of tea brewing. Or maybe you're just an elegant person who drinks in small volumes. 

This crow from behind is my favorite. Mysterious.

Then she turns and makes awkward eye contact. Whut?

This is the least successful carving although the one I love the most from the reference sketch. I can't get that head tilt right yet!

This mug marks a turning point based on a fluid sketch, less like a plan with very clear clean outlines, less like a cartoon, less controlled. I like stuff that has a weird messy energy.

Carving clay feels amazing. Sometimes I _crave_ it (not making that up). I loved the chaos of carving those horizontal stripes. Chaos gremlin release!

Durable stoneware, dishwasher and microwave safe.

**Process notes**

This is the reference sketch I made to work from.

And here's an example of the reference pictures I'm taking of MY CROWS lately because they trust me and come when I whistle and come very close to me. Squeeeeeeeeeeee.
