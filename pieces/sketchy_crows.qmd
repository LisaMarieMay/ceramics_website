Okay, so this is important to me because it's more fluid, more like a sketch, more kinda seeing what happens. Less like a plan with very clear clean outlines, less like a cartoon, less controlled. I like stuff that has a weird messy energy. 

Carving clay feels amazing. Sometimes I _crave_ it (not making that up). I loved the chaos of carving those horizontal stripes. Chaos gremlin release!

This crow from behind is my favorite. Mysterious.

Then she turns and make awkward eye contact. Whut?

This is the least successful carving although the one I love the most from the reference sketch. I can't get that head tilt right yet!

This is the reference sketch I made to work from.

And here's an example of the reference pictures I'm taking of MY CROWS lately because they trust me and come when I whistle and come very close to me. Squeeeeeeeeeeee.
