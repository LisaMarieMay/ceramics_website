This mug, she shines bright. Guaranteed good vibes with bright orange and turquoise. It gives me the feeling of a herd of animals moving across a plain or tropical fish in a coral reef. Collective life, moving together, vibrant color.  

It's a great mug for holding, _the texture is very satisfying_. 

Durable stoneware, dishwasher and microwave safe.

**Process notes**

I woke up in the middle of the night to carve this. Each mark is hand carved. Small repetitive hand movements are so soothing.
Then it was bisque fired and I added the turquoise, wiped it back so only the blue stayed in the marks, and added clear glaze.
