A good mug is tactile. I care about how it feels in my hands. I need to be able to cradle it with two hands, but also to hold it in one hand with fingers through the handle. 

The handle feel is important, too! I've been inspired by the great Lane May (child extrordinaire) to make wide flat slab handles instead of pulled/coil handles. I like the way they feel. 

These mugs are "stoneware", which means they're from a dense clay fired at high temperatures. Stoneware is super strong, chip resistant, and good for everyday use - microwaves, ovens, dishwashers...if you drop one of these mugs it might hurt your toe but probably won't hurt the mug. 

Each mug is handmade and one-of-a-kind. Lately I've been thinking about mugs as canvases. Functional little paintings.
