This a set of four small plates is an ode to parental patience and how hard it is to raise kids. :) They’re little plates - perfect for dunking chicken nuggets in ketchup or holding your rings."

Each mark is hand carved. Small repetitive hand movements are so soothing.

Or maybe you’re just an elegant person who drinks in small volumes.\nThis crow from behind is my favorite. Mysterious. \nThen she turns and makes awkward eye contact. Whut? \nThis is the least successful carving although the one I love the most from the reference sketch. I can’t get that head tilt right yet! \nThis mug marks a turning point based on a fluid sketch, less like a plan with very clear clean outlines, less like a cartoon, less controlled. I like stuff that has a weird messy energy.\nCarving clay feels amazing. Sometimes I crave it (not making that up). I loved the chaos of carving those horizontal stripes. Chaos gremlin release!\nDurable stoneware, dishwasher and microwave safe.\nProcess notes\nThis is the reference sketch I made to work from. \nAnd here’s an example of the reference pictures I’m taking of MY CROWS lately because they trust me and come when I whistle and come very close to me.

I’ve been thinking about doors lately as points of transition, especially house doors. The transition between what’s internal and private vs. external and public. How we navigate those choices. Doors to different futures, possible choices, other dimensions.\nThis piece marks a turning point for me: it’s where I started treating mugs as tiny canvases, sketching out a composition based on the space."

Like…changing your job or go through a breakup…like you live in the same town but never see all the people you used to see every day. Or you start a new hobby or make a new friend and that gives you a whole new social world. All of these lives are going on around us and it doesn’t take much to make the world feel totally different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe feeling of the different whales relating to one another— they’re playing, they’re dancing, they’re in their bodies and joyful.

For these, I always need the mountains/land/horizon to be waaaayyy down on the mug, because I’m chasing that feeling of laying in a field as a kid in the plains of Montana, with the sky a bowl above me. BIG SKY.\nThis mug will do you right. She’s good to hold, she’s a good size (14 oz/413 mL), good vibes.\nDurable stoneware, dishwasher and microwave safe.\nProcess Pic"
