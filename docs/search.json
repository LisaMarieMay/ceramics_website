This a set of four small plates is an ode to parental patience and how hard it is to raise kids. :) They’re little plates - perfect for dunking chicken nuggets in ketchup or holding your rings."

I’ve been thinking about doors lately. Points of transition, especially house doors as the transition between what’s internal and private vs. external and public. How we navigate those choices. Doors to different futures, possible choices, other dimensions.\nThis piece marks a turning point for me: it’s where I started treating mugs as tiny canvases, sketching out a composition based on the space. (Why green? Couldn’t tell you.)"
