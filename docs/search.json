    "text": "A good mug is tactile. I care about how it feels in my hands. I need to be able to cradle it with two hands, but also to hold it in one hand with fingers through the handle.\nThe handle feel is important, too! I’ve been inspired by the great Lane May (child extrordinaire) to make wide flat slab handles instead of pulled/coil handles. I like the way they feel.\nThese mugs are “stoneware”, which means they’re from a dense clay fired at high temperatures. Stoneware is super strong, chip resistant, and good for everyday use - microwaves, ovens, dishwashers…if you drop one of these mugs it might hurt your toe but probably won’t hurt the mug.\nEach mug is handmade and one-of-a-kind. Lately I’ve been thinking about mugs as canvases.

You know, the sunlight zone, the twilight zone… we were the bottom dwellers in this tall tall space and there could be different biological niches above us and we’d just be oblivious to it.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\nIn real life, it can feel like your entire biological niche changes when you change your social circle. Like…changing your job or go through a breakup…like you live in the same town but never see all the people you used to see every day. Or you start a new hobby or make a new friend and that gives you a whole new social world. All of these lives are going on around us and it doesn’t take much to make the world feel totally different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe feeling of the different whales relating to one another— they’re playing, they’re dancing, they’re in their bodies and joyful. Movement. A sense of movement and connectedness. What must it feel like to dive like that? To be that powerful of a swimmer?"

Sometimes I crave it (not making that up). I loved the chaos of carving those horizontal stripes. Chaos gremlin release!\nThis crow from behind is my favorite. Mysterious. \nThen she turns and make awkward eye contact. Whut? \nThis is the least successful carving although the one I love the most from the reference sketch. I can’t get that head tilt right yet! \nThis is the reference sketch I made to work from. \nAnd here’s an example of the reference pictures I’m taking of MY CROWS lately because they trust me and come when I whistle and come very close to me.

    "text": "I got up in the middle of the night with this strong urge to carve. Not really about a final image, but a feeling of what my hands wanted to do. So I got up and carved this. In art school people talked about “being interested in mark making*” and I always thought that was pretentious. But there’s something soothing about making the same motion over and over - repetitive hand movements. Why knitting, coloring, all kinds of things are soothing. I find working with clay therapeutic, and it was soothing to do this just focused on the feeling, not with an image of how I wanted it to turn out.\nGlaze notes: So far it’s saffron yellow and flame Speedball underglaze. After bisque, I want to fill in the carving spots with black or brown underglaze, then glaze the whole thing maybe with saffron glaze?\n*Note: the only other time I heard this was daycare teachers talking about babies making art - just being interested in what it’s like to make a mark."
