This a set of four small plates is an ode to parental patience and how hard it is to raise kids. :) They’re little plates - perfect for dunking chicken nuggets in ketchup or holding your rings."

    "text": "I got up in the middle of the night with this strong urge to carve. Not really about a final image, but a feeling of what my hands wanted to do. So I got up and carved this. In art school people talked about “being interested in mark making*” and I always thought that was pretentious. But there’s something soothing about making the same motion over and over - repetitive hand movements. Why knitting, coloring, all kinds of things are soothing. I find working with clay therapeutic, and it was soothing to do this just focused on the feeling, not with an image of how I wanted it to turn out.\nGlaze notes: So far it’s saffron yellow and flame Speedball underglaze. After bisque, I want to fill in the carving spots with black or brown underglaze, then glaze the whole thing maybe with saffron glaze?\n*Note: the only other time I heard this was daycare teachers talking about babies making art - just being interested in what it’s like to make a mark."

Sometimes I crave it (not making that up). I loved the chaos of carving those horizontal stripes. Chaos gremlin release!\nThis crow from behind is my favorite. Mysterious. \nThen she turns and make awkward eye contact. Whut? \nThis is the least successful carving although the one I love the most from the reference sketch. I can’t get that head tilt right yet! \nThis is the reference sketch I made to work from. \nAnd here’s an example of the reference pictures I’m taking of MY CROWS lately because they trust me and come when I whistle and come very close to me.

I bought two tiny envelopes, mostly choosing b/c these were two that were I think that were the least expensive. \nI’ve been reading a lot about it. I’m going to wedge each of these into a 1.25 to 1.5 lb of clay and see what happens.\nSupposedly the celadon has cobalt in it so it’s more likely to be bright.\nOh yeah, and both of these are toxic heavy metals.
