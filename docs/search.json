The begging went on for days. Man, oh man, it really made me empathize with the parents. And crows do it every year! This a set of four small plates is an ode to parental patience and how hard it is to raise kids. :) They’re little plates - perfect for dunking chicken nuggets in ketchup or holding your rings."

    "text": "I got up in the middle of the night with this strong urge to carve. Not really about a final image, but a feeling of what my hands wanted to do. So I got up and carved this. In art school people talked about “being interested in mark making*” and I always thought that was pretentious. But there’s something soothing about making the same motion over and over - repetitive hand movements. Why knitting, coloring, all kinds of things are soothing. I find working with clay therapeutic, and it was soothing to do this just focused on the feeling, not with an image of how I wanted it to turn out.\nGlaze notes: So far it’s saffron yellow and flame Speedball underglaze. After bisque, I want to fill in the carving spots with black or brown underglaze, then glaze the whole thing maybe with saffron glaze?\n*Note: the only other time I heard this was daycare teachers talking about babies making art - just being interested in what it’s like to make a mark."
