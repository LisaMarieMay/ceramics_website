# To-Do

- [ ] Add alt text to all images
- [ ] Make "work in progress" category automatically set as draft (don't publish unfinished pieces)
- [ ] Reorganize top menu:
  - [ ] "Available for purchase" first
  - [ ] Gallery second
  - [ ] Category pages (mugs, etc.) less prominent
- [ ] Add section for new work not yet available (to show friends)
- [ ] Improve purchasing text
- [ ] Expand artist statement
- [ ] Add commissions language (inquiries welcome, selective about projects — cool ideas from good people)
